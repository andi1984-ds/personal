          <h2>Welcome!</h2>
          <p>
            Hi everyone! I&apos;m excited to be here and learn along with all of
            you. I&apos;m based in south-west Germany, dabbling in web
            development with a focus on React and TypeScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            This space is where I&apos;ll share what I&apos;m learning, the
            challenges I face, and the little victories along the way. I&apos;m
            not an expert, but I believe in learning by doing and sharing that
            experience with others.
          </p>

          <h2>Here&apos;s What I&apos;ll Be Talking About:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>üìö My learning journey with React and TypeScript.</li>
            <li>üõ†Ô∏è Tips and tricks that I find useful or interesting.</li>
            <li>üí° Projects I&apos;m working on, no matter how small.</li>
            <li>üåà Discussions on anything web development related.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>If You&apos;re New Here:</h2>
          <p>
            Don&apos;t worry, so am I! We&apos;ll figure this out together.
            I&apos;ll share resources that I find helpful and hope they&apos;ll
            help you too.
          </p>

          <h2>It&apos;s Not All About Coding:</h2>
          <p>
            Besides coding, I love gardening and mentoring kids in coding. So,
            expect some fun detours and stories about these adventures.
          </p>

          <h2>Let&apos;s Learn and Grow Together!</h2>
          <p>
            I&apos;m here to connect, share, and learn. Feel free to join the
            conversation, share your thoughts, or just drop a hello. Let&apos;s
            support each other on this journey.
